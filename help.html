    <h1>Craftsman of Sevendral</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to the mines! You seek fortune and glory by mining ores and gathering materials to ultimately craft the Amulet of Sevendral. However, you must contend with enemies who want to stop you!
    </p>

    <h2>Basic actions</h2>
    <p>Most actions are explained in-game, but some things may benefit from clarification:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mine the walls by bumping into them, but it may take multiple bumps to finish mining a block</li>
      <li>You can return to your workshop at any time, and be fully healed thereby</li>
      <li>Descending to a lower level means you can never reenter the current level</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Combat</h2>
    <p>Combat is a variant of the system in <a href="http://sevendral.com">Caverns of Sevendral</a>: enemies move toward you after each of your moves. An enemy adjacent to you does damage to you. Bumping an enemy shoves him away; moving toward an enemy from one space away kills him.</p>
    <p>The differences between the two games are: in <em>Craftsman</em>, shoving an enemy into a wall (or other enemy) also kills him, and there exist "elite" enemies that do more damage and can only be killed by shoving (not lunging).</p>
    <p>Enemies will slowly but unstoppably spawn out of your vision. They will only be awoken by seeing you, but the mines are never <em>safe,</em> merely <em>managed.</em></p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The mines contain several things besides ores, and many are more useful. I only had a week, I didn't put in anything you don't need :)</li>
      <li>Money isn't everything</li>
      <li>Your plans can be changed immediately by the appearance of an elite</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Credits and acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>This was written by me, <a href="mailto:ross.andrews@gmail.com">Ross Andrews</a>, for 7DRL 2024 in March 2024. But it would not have been possible without the existence of a couple external things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The always-excellent library <a href="https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/">rot.js</a> for allowing me to concentrate on game design and not reimplementing pathfinding for the nth time</li>
      <li><a href="https://react.dev/">React</a> for significantly reducing the headaches involved in displaying a moderately complicated UI in a web page</li>
      <li>And of course <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> for making it far easier to use both the others and still have one easily-deployed minified file :)</li>
    </ul>
